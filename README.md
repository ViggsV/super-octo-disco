## Potential Improvements

* Let users sign up and log in.
* Store posts on a server so they’re backed up online.
* Add a dark/light mode switch.
* Allow comments on posts.
* Show notifications when someone likes your post.
* Add profile page
* Add a specific theme

## Developer Notes

* This is just a quick demo
* For a bigger app, you’d add a backend (server) and user accounts.
* Right now, everything is kept in your browser—so if you clear your storage, posts go away.
